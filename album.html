    <p>Under the Grey Banner is the fifth studio album by Swedish power metal band Dragonland. The album was released on November

        created the cover artwork for this chapter of the Dragonland saga. The album's title track is Dragonland's longest
        song to date (not counting the "Book of Shadows" saga and the "Old House on the Hill" saga), lasting for over eight
        minutes. The song's outro has the same melody as "Hundred Years Have Passed", the intro of the album, Holy War.</p>
